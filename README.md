## React Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list with persistent data storage.

To start with, we have a styled todo list that supports adding todos. We also have premade styles for completed todo items. Although there's no working mechanism for "completing" a todo.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the "checked" state. âœ…
2. The todo list state should be saved and loaded from local storage. âœ…
3. Checked items should sink to the bottom of the list automatically âœ…

## Stretch Goals

1. Allow todos to be deleted. When you hover your mouse over a todo, an X should appear on the far right side, clicking the X should remove it from the list. âœ…

2. Add hidden timestamps to todos (createdAt, completedAt), these will be used for sorting

- The active todos should be sorted by createdAt descending âœ…
- The completed todos should be sorted by completedAt ascending âœ…

## Other additions:

1. Add Prettier âœ…
2. Unit tests for the sortTodos models function with vitest âœ…

## TODO

1. Add https://zod.dev/ to properly parse what's coming from localStorage âœ…
2. Update to React 18 âœ…
3. Add a quick Github Action to run lint / tests âœ…
4. Add a nice icon for the delete button (taken from https://heroicons.com/) âœ…
5. Deploy to vercel âœ…
